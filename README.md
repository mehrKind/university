Program description:
The student id of students entering the year 400 is between the numbers 2 and 50, the entry 401 is between 51 and 100, and the entry 99 is between 101 and 150.
In the first part of the program, by entering the number 1, the student registration process starts.
By default, the number 500 is for the teacher's ID. If we enter the number 500, we will enter the teacher's panel, and if we enter one of the student numbers, we will enter the student's panel. After entering the student number, the program will determine which year the student is entering.
Master panel:
In the first part, the professor can define lessons for all three years.
The next parts are for adding or removing students, viewing messages sent by students, entering grades of courses chosen by students, etc.
Student panel:
The student panel consists of parts such as sending a message to the teacher, viewing the lessons defined by the teacher, choosing the defined lessons and viewing the grade given by the teacher to each lesson. The grade entered by the teacher is before and after the name of the courses, respectively.
In order, from left to right, the grade of the first lesson corresponds to the first grade.
The rest are very clear and complete.
